# Hugo Art Portfolio / Blog
*Reconstructing a website portfolio with Hugo, a static site generator*

I'll update this README as the project goes on, but for now, it's mainly for my own reference- to remember everything that's necessary, in case I have memory loss.

## To Build:
1. Make sure you're in the project directory. `cd /Applications/MAMP/htdocs/portfolio-hugo`

2. Run `gulp` for sass style changes.

3. Run `hugo server -D` to build site.
