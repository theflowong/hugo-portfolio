# Hugo Art Portfolio / Blog
*Reconstructing a website portfolio with Hugo, a static site generator*

I'll update this README as the project goes on, but for now, it's mainly for my own reference, to remember everything that's necessary.

## To Build:
1. Run `gulp` for sass style changes.

2. Run `hugo server -D` to build site.
