## Life Philosophy
I believe we need to live with *intention*, *awareness*, and *kindness*, to think hard and critically about the societal systems we design and live in, the effects they perpetuate for us, and how our moral and social values fit in with them.

Since I have the privilege to work with art, design, and code, I want to use my abilities as a voice (or a picture) to raise awareness on issues, to elicit conversation, reflection, and action, to tell the stories of those often unheard (or unseen), or "unthought."

### Why am I vegan? (or, a plant-based advocate?)

Throughout my life, I've investigated and written about the food industry and factory farming, and had a multitude of conversations with people from different cultures about the ethics of eating animals.

It's evident we have a huge global problem: our unsustainable food systems, corruption in our meat, dairy and egg industries, and factory farming practices are detrimental to our health, environment, and animals.

There's no simple global solution, because the food and meat industries are intertwined with so many different systems. But it's clear to me my individual solution: simply, to adopt a plant-based diet and lifestyle. It's extremely accessible, considering we live in 2017 and have the resources to do so, with just a little research, motivation, and open-mindedness to try new dishes.


### Other Advocacies

Otherwise, here are a few other things I believe are important.

- Equality and justice for minorities, women, LGBTQIA+, the environment, immigrants, international students, animals
- Love and Power, not War and Peace: creating a culture of empathy through listening and building.
- Moral dialogue, reflection and consistency
- Designing for *social good*

Additionally, the amount of life, energy and beauty in the natural world inspires me, so often shows up as a theme in my art.

### Other Interests

Here are some things I'm exploring, or find intruiging or fun:

- <a href="https://80000hours.org/">Effective altruism</a>
- Longboard dancing (my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7os4K_xI9Y">role model</a>)

## Life Background

Life is a continuous educational journey. I'm currently residing in Vancouver, BC, working towards a Masters for Digital Media at the <a href="https://thecdm.ca/">Centre for Digital Media</a>.

I grew up in Hong Kong among <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_culture_kid">third culture kids</a> in an international school, and graduated with a Studio Art degree in 2016 from a liberal arts college Carleton College while living in an intentional commune.

From there, I moved to my second home, Minneapolis, MN, USA. It's an artistic mecca fortified by these amazingly strong communities and people â€” I found myself constantly inspired by those around me, and feeling lucky. I worked at the <a href="http://www.walkerart.org">Walker Art Center</a>, and taught classes at <a href="http://highpointprintmaking.org">Highpoint Center for Printmaking</a>, promoting the arts scene among local communities in Minneapolis, as well as freelance design and artwork commissions for local nonprofits and businesses including Compassionate Action for Animals, TABAH, and Green Creamery. Unfortunately, I had to leave after a year due to my status as a non-citizen and Trump's presidency.
