## Life Philosophy
I believe we need to live with *intention*, *awareness*, and *empathy*. We need to think hard and critically about the societal systems we live in and design for ourselves, how we might perpetuate them, and how they might complement or contradict our moral and social values.

Since I have the privilege to work with art, design, and code, I want to use my abilities as a voice (or visualization) to raise awareness on issues: to elicit conversation, reflection, and action, to tell the stories of the underdogs, the ones who are often unheard (or unseen), or "unthought."

### Plant-Based Advocacy Ⓥ

This is an extremely complex and contentious issue, but something I still believe strongly in.

On the surface, our industrial food systems are pretty efficient, productive, and able to feed many mouths. But it's also not sustainable, funded by questionable interests, and sacrifice longer-term problems with short-term results.

I want my work to reveal some of the more sinister practices of our meat/dairy/egg industries and factory farming, especially their detrimental effects to our health, environment, and animals.

Evidently, there are many factors that complicate the problem. These industries are intertwined with many aspects of our everyday lives and systems. And there's no simple solution.

That said, I still think a culture of plant-based advocacy can go a long way in reducing the damage of our consumption habits: whether it be ethical, environmental, or health-related. On an individual scale, we can eat more plants to reduce our meat, egg, dairy consumption.

Thankfully, we live in an age of technology and information where there exists more awareness, resources, accessibility, affordability for anyone wanting to try a plant-based lifestyle, and more people are adopting some aspect of it into their lives.


### Other Advocacies

Otherwise, here are a few other things I'm actively advocating for.

- Equal rights and consideration: for minorities, women, LGBTQIA+, the environment, immigrants, international students, and other species besides humans.
- Love and Power (not War vs Peace): creating a culture of empathy through cooperative dialogue and action.
- Critical moral dialogue, reflection and consistency.
- Designing for *social good*.

Additionally, the amount of life, energy and beauty in the natural world inspires me, so often shows up as a theme in my work.

## Life Background

Life is a continuous educational journey. I'm currently residing in Vancouver, BC, working on product development digital projects at the <a href="https://thecdm.ca/">Centre for Digital Media</a>, and working towards a Masters Degree.

Before that, I worked among the local arts scene in my other home and artistic mecca, Minneapolis, MN, USA. I created freelance design and artwork commissions for local businesses, nonprofits, and startups, including Compassionate Action for Animals, TABAH, and Green Creamery. I also worked as a visitor services associate at the <a href="http://www.walkerart.org">Walker Art Center</a>, taught weekly workshops to different classes at <a href="http://highpointprintmaking.org">Highpoint Center for Printmaking</a>, and occasionally TA-ed for <a href="http://gdiminneapolis.com/">Girl Develop It Minneapolis</a>. Minneapolis is fortified by these amazingly strong communities and people — I found myself constantly inspired by those around me, and feeling lucky.

I grew up in Hong Kong among <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_culture_kid">third culture kids</a> in an international school with a plan to pursue Mathematics and change the world, and graduated with a Studio Art degree in 2016 from liberal arts college <a href="https://www.usnews.com/best-colleges/carleton-college-2340/overall-rankings">Carleton College</a> while living in an intentional commune.

In my spare time, I can be found longboarding (my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7os4K_xI9Y">role model</a>), obsessing over a new hobby, working on old and new <a class="effect " href="https://github.com/theflowong">projects</a>, or doing absolutely nothing at all (and loving it).
