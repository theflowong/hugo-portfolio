When I visited my alma mater last fall, I was inspired by the amount of life in the Arboretum, and decided to create an animated visualization of a breathing autumn landscape.

This was made with <a href="http://processingjs.org/">Processing</a>, a language that combines coding with art. I used object-oriented programming to create animated mathematical functions resulting in a rhythm of colors and pulses for the trees, moon, and land.

See my code for <a href="https://github.com/theflowong/trippy_trees">Breathing Trees</a> on Github!
