These are a random collection of oil paintings and studies that I've done in the past, under the supervisor <a href="http://www.davidlefkowitz.net">David Lefkowitz</a>. Check him out, he's great!

In retrospect, a common thread to these paintings was their element of magical surrealism depicting fantastical dream-like landscapes.

I've always aspired to portray my dreams, so my paintings might be reflecting that desire subconsciously.

"Wild" is a hybrid oil painting of Salvador Dali's "The Dream" and Henri Rousseau's "Sleeping Gypsy."
