## Project Brief

Series of three, oil on cardboard, 18"x12"
2015

As consumers, we're constantly surrounded by advertisements that feed us unreliable information and make us desire more than we need.

This series comments on aspects of our food industry regarding our oppressive relationships with non-human animals, ranging from the evident concept that a consumer choice results in the death of an animal, to more obscure, lesser-known realities like artificial insemination processes or the grinding up of male chicks in the milk and egg industry.

By mimicking particular trademark brands and commercials, the series aims to convey the very own hushed secrets of the industry that advertisements try to conceal in the first place.

*I'm Mournin' It* is the first of three in my "Honest Food Advertisements" series parodying iconic food advertisements, instead depicting the animals’ perspectives of these food items.

Using iconic McDonald's colors and parodying its *I'm Lovin' It* campaign, *I'm Mournin' It* shows the literal meat of a burger.

## Got Consent?

*Got Consent?* is the second of three in my "Honest Food Advertisements" series parodying iconic food advertisements, instead depicting the animals’ perspectives of these food items.

Dairy cows must be pregnant to produce milk. As a result, the milk industry has to constantly artificially inseminate and impregnate cows to induce lactation.

*Got Consent?* is an alternative reading on the *Got Milk?* advertisements that promote milk and dairy consumption.


## Kinder Egg

*Kinder Egg* is the third of three in my "Honest Food Advertisements" series parodying iconic food advertisements, instead depicting the animals’ perspectives of these food items.

Male chicks (making up half of hatched eggs) are ground up alive when born, as they are unable to lay eggs and provide no production value for the egg industry.

*Kinder Egg* is a take on a real product called "Kinder" egg, a real brand that sells egg-shaped chocolates instead of real chicken eggs.
