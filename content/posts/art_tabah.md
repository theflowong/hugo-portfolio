## Project Brief

Minneapolis indie rock band <a href="https://www.facebook.com/tabahofficial/">TABAH</a> reached out to me to create five original limited-edition album jackets for a pre-release sale for their album _Symmetry Somewhere_.

The concept was simple: I was given two weeks and five physical album jackets to create original artwork. I had the privilege of listening to _Symmetry Somewhere_, and create what came to mind. They had seen my portfolio and liked my artistic style, so wanted me to surprise them at the end. There were no specifications on medium, theme, etc. — the only constraint was the size of these jackets.

I'm glad they trusted me with my creative direction. I kicked off the project by researching different types of music album covers, ways sound is envisioned and abstracted, and thinking of different ways to visualize the emotions and style that _Symmetry Somewhere_ evokes.

In the end, I went in two directions: jackets that honored **individual musicians** in the band, and jackets that had more of an **abstract** style conveying the feeling of their music.

## Project Result
### Individual Musicians
For the first two jackets, I wanted to show the actual band members themselves.

During their performances, anyone in the audience can see how passionate each band member is about the music. Their social media pages convey an **intimate**, **humble**, and **down to earth** style doing everyday activities and enjoying playing music.

Hence, for the first album jacket, I decided to take a more **intimate** feel. I focused on the members' facial expressions when performing. Each vertical slice is highly **individualized**, with each band member enjoying the music in their own way. The colour palette is a **warm**, pinkish purplish sunset tone that often appears in their social media posts for performances.

The next jacket also captures the band, but has an extremely different feel. Their music felt like a blend of jazz, indie, and rock. Rather than highlighting an intimate close-up of the artists' facial expressions, I wanted to show a communal band that sticks together. Everyone is a black-and-white semi-silhouette with no facial features, to create a unified sense of group belonging. I wanted this to capture a sense of **humility**, a bit of **mood** that their music produces, **anonymity** and **mystery**.

### Abstracted Sound
