I had a lot of fun with this project.

Sometimes we just want yummy breakfasts — and we end up forgetting about the actual food and industries we're supporting.

We know that bacon comes from slaughtered pigs, but producing eggs and dairy often have cruel side effects too.

With efficiency comes cruelty in our food industry: to weed out unproductive units of production, baby male chicks are ground up alive from the egg industry, and calves are slaughtered for veal in the dairy industry.

I wanted to create an experience where people can visually recognize the the food they're eating — yet also be reminded of where their food comes from.

Sometimes we just need a little reminder and nudge to remember that what we're eating, the "units of production" as the industry sees them, also feel pain and suffer.

Fortunately, it's increasingly easier for us to avoid contributing to this suffering, espeically in our day and age, where plant-based meals are just as delicious and easily accessible.
