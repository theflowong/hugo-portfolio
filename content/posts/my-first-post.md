These are a random collection of oil paintings and studies that I've done in the past, under the supervisor David Lefkowitz. Check him out, he's great!

In retrospect, a common thread to these paintings was their element of magical surrealism depicting fantastical dream-like landscapes.

I've always aspired to portray my dreams, so my paintings might be reflecting that desire subonsciously.
