For a more colourful version of my sketchbook, see my <a href="../watercolours/">watercolours</a>.

Winter of 2015, I had the chance to study abroad and travel around cities and national parks in the Cook Islands, New Zealand, and Australia with print and book artist <a href="http://www.people.carleton.edu/~fhagstro/index.html">Fred Hagstrom</a>. I carried hand-bound sketchbooks with me, so whenever I observed something intriguing, I recorded it visually. Being constantly surrounded by pristine landscapes and cityscapes makes one realize the beauty and magnitude of nature.

Here are some of my works from the pages of my sketchbooks.
