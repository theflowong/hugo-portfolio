Winter of 2016, I was lucky to learn Handbuilding from <a href="http://www.kipokrongly.com/">Kip O'Krongly</a>, an amazing ceramics artist who advocates for environmental awareness through her work.

An extremely invigorating process, it's the reason why I spent half my winter 2016 waking hours in the studio.

For this project, I created a place setting themed around surreal nature settings and organic shapes. Here, I was combining 3D experimentation with 2D expertise — I think the fusion of 3D and 2D play well together to create something striking yet functional.

Here are some of my babies! All have been either sold, or gifted to people who've had an impact on my life. And that's something I like about ceramics — that you're leaving a part of yourself in the everyday use of someone's life.
