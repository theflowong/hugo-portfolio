I took Handbuilding winter of 2016 with <a href="http://www.kipokrongly.com/">Kip O'Krongly</a>, an amazing ceramics artist who advocates for environmental	awareness through her work.

An extremely invigorating process, it's the reason why I spent half my winter 2016 waking hours in the studio.

I loved not only creating shapes from clay, but also being able to paint surreal designs (evidently inspired by nature) on the surfaces.

Here are some of my functional works!
