Series of three, oil on wood, 48"x40"
2016

Humans generally think of animals as units of production, objects to use for advantaging the human. Yet similarly to us, animals feel pain, suffer, and the desire to live and be social.

For five months, I created large-scale (4 feet tall) oil paintings of humorous human-animal role-reversal scenarios to hopefully foster empathy and reflection on the situations we put animals in.

They're supposed to be funny. Hope you like them!

<!--
<p>Let’s face it: our world is undeniably anthropocentric.</p>
<p>As humans, we’ve outdone every other species.
We’re different; we philosophize, produce art and music,
and battle in the name of politics and religion.
Yet our defining characteristics that distinguish
us from the rest of the world bring us back to
take responsibility and care for it;
to be human is to be humane.
We’re in the midst of a social justice era,
yet one system of oppression we tend to overlook —
and often indirectly support — is the oppression
against nonhuman animals in our daily lives.</p>
<p>Through my art, I wish to explore the way
    humans interact with animals.
    By depicting scenarios where roles
    of humans and nonhumans are reversed —
    literally placing humans in the shoes of animals —
    I hope to use humor as a tool to let viewers
    contemplate the absurdity of situations we place
    nonhuman animals in, and reflect on their own
    everyday consumption that may support these systems.
